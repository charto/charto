cdata
=====

This is a library of generic and efficient data structures written in TypeScript.

`BinaryHeap`
------------

Classic binary heap with O(lon(n)) insert, delete-min and decrease-key
(assuming a min-heap). The comparison function is user-provided to support a
min-heap or max-heap of arbitrary items.

`SplayTree`
-----------

Binary tree with O(log(n)) amortized insert and remove. Items also form a linked list,
allowing quick traversal.
